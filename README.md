# fin-discontinued-

Use `fin()` in place of `cin` to get automatic echo of stdin to stdout.
It can be useful when studying problem solving with C++.
With a test_input prepared, just
`./main <test_input`
where main is compiled with `fin()` instead of `cin`.
It outputs exactly what the programs reads and outputs, in which order.
